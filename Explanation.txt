You are given with two arrays of size n and m, and a digit k,
Create the maximum number of length k <= m(arr1) + n(arr2) from digits of the two. The relative order of the digits from the same array must be preserved. 
Return an array of the k digits.
Note: The numbers should be from 0-9.

Input description:
First line contains, n,m,k. (1<m,n,k<100).
Second line contains n size of array1 in integers.
Third line contains m size of array2 in integers.

Output Description:
Print the largest k digits array.
